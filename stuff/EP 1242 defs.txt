From the formula<br><b>V = IR</b><br>identify each symbol and state its SI units
V - potential difference   volt (v)<br>I - current   Ampere (A)<br>R - resistance   Ohm (&ohm;)
State Ohmâ€™s Law
The current flowing through a conductor is proportional to the potential difference across its ends<br>V = I R
State the current and voltage relationships for resistors connected in series
The same current flows in each series resistor. The pd across each series resistor is proportional to the value of the resistor
State the current and voltage relationships for resistors connected in parallel
The pd across each parallel resistor is the same. The current flowing through each parallel resistor is inversely proportional to the value of the resistor
